        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Catzeau is the first HTML5 canvas game I have developed, and one of the larger projects I've done with JavaScript. Made for a university assignment for <em>'Client Side Graphics Programming for the Web'</em>.</p>

        <h3>Theme</h3>
        <p>I wanted to make a game that would be simple enough to play, but tricky enough to hold a players interest. I also wanted to make a game that would
        be replayable and could have a 'beat my score' aspect between friends.</p>
        <p>After considering other ideas (i.e. side-scrolling R-Type games), I decided upon a game where
        you play a cat, using the left and right mouse buttons as the left and right paws, respectively. The base concept is simple, but could be built upon to become quite
        complex.</p>
